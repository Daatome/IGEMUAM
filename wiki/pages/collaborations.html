        <p class="mt-5">As a team, we know that collaborations are a fundamental core in the iGEM Competition; they help not just with networking but also with having different points of view from people with different geographical backgrounds and cultures. These interactions help enrich every iGEM project and unify science against geographic boundaries. We are happy to present to you all the collaborations in which we participated throughout the season.

        <p class="mt-2">This LATAM meet-up took place over two days. On the first day, we learned about other team perspectives, strategies, and possible project ideas they were going to implement in the competition. We had the opportunity to see different points of view and how other teams brainstormed to solve local problems with synthetic biology.  On the second day, we had a conversatory with other LATAM teams. The main focus was to discuss general problems surrounding an iGEM project. We concluded that we had similar problems such as organization, fundraising, and even sometimes lack of team motivation. It was a great way to share advice and provide guidance between the LATAM teams. These helped us generate ideas for our projects and to plan possible collaborations with the synbio LATAM community.</p>
