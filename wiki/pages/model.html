            <h2 class="blog-title-line"></h2>
            <p>Spiders have developed large complex repertoires of peptides in their venoms with various pharmacological and agricultural applications for more than 300 million years (Saez & Herzig, 2019). These peptides are made up of characteristic three-dimensional folds that give them stability and resistance (King, 2019). In this way, spider venom peptides potently and selectively modulate a wide variety of targets, such as ion channels and signaling pathways that are involved in important physiological processes. In addition to the above, due to the multiple disulfide bonds they present, these peptides have remarkable stability within the intestine of insects (King & Hardy, 2013).</p>
            <p>Spiders use these peptides to incapacitate prey by modulating the activity of their voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels, which can be classified as pore blockers, which physically obstruct the channel pore, or as modifiers of the channel gate, since they alter the entrance of the channel through interactions with one or more specific domains of the same (Shen et al., 2018).</p>

            <h2 class="blog-subtitle">Selected Peptides</h2>
            <h2 class="blog-title-line"></h2>
            <p class="mt-2">For spider venom peptides selection, an extensive bibliographic research of these was carried out and a database was established with many peptides from different species of spiders. In the first place, the peptides were selected according to their selectivity in invertebrates, and those that showed affinity in vertebrate ion channels were discarded, likewise, an important parameter within the selection of peptides was the insecticidal effect that they exerted on the insect order Coleoptera.</p>
            <p>Finally, we reviewed their mechanism of action and the number of disulfide bonds they contained, since these have a great influence on conferring biological stability to the peptide. Based on the specifications mentioned above, the selected peptides were Omega-Hexatoxin-Hv2a (AcTx-Hv2a) and U1-Theraphotoxin-Sp1a (OAIP-1).</p>
            <p>AcTx-Hv2a from the Australian spider Hadronyche versuta and OAIP-1 from the Australian tarantula Selenotypus plumipes are two insecticidal peptides that target voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels of insects belonging to the orders Coleoptera, Diptera, Dictyoptera, Orthoptera, and Lepidoptera. Both peptides form a cysteine knot, resulting in three disulfide bonds, providing the peptides with biological stability that contributes to their oral activity and resistance to proteases (Hardy et al., 2013).</p>

            <p class="mt-2">ω-Hexatoxin-Hv2a (ω-HXTX-Hv2a or AcTx-Hv2) is a specific and potent blocker of voltage-gated calcium channels. It is a 45 amino acid peptide containing a compact disulfide-rich core, including a highly hydrophobic C-terminal tail that is essential for interaction with insect calcium channels, the three disulfide bridges in the hydrophobic core form a binding motif inhibitory cysteine (Wang et al., 2001)</p>

            <h2 class="blog-title-line"></h2>
            <p>One of the main challenges we encountered using spider venom peptides was their low oral efficiency. These proteins evolved to be injected directly into their prey by the spider. Therefore, they do not possess the mechanisms for oral absorption, being less effective when administered orally. We overcame this challenge by designing a fusion protein, merging each insecticidal peptide with a carrier. Fusion proteins built with a lectin from the Galanthus nivalis agglutinin (GNA) plant significantly improve oral efficiency thanks to its ability to cross through the intestinal epithelium, delivering the peptides to the hemolymph of the insect. Additionally, with the GNA lectin, we improved protein stability and resistance against proteolysis (Powell et al., 2020).</p>

            <p class="text-center">Mechanism of action of GNA to transport peptides to the insect hemolymph. In the digestive tract, GNA binds to glycoproteins of the intestinal epithelium, crosses the epithelial cell by endocytosis and exocytosis and is transported to the hemolymph.</p>
            <p>The fusion proteins assembled were the AcTx-Hv2a/GNA and OAIP-1/GNA. Each peptide was attached to the N-terminal end of GNA with a three-alanine linker, to allow maximum flexibility (Crasto & Feng, 2000). The alanine linker was constructed as reported by Pyati and collaborators, 2014.</p>

            <p>To fuse the AcTx-Hv2a and OAIP-1 peptides with a GNA via the three-alanine linker we used the methodology that follows:</p>
            <p>We used the program MOE (Molecular Operating Environment to visualize the sequence of the proteins and create the sequence of the three-alanine linker. We neared the C-terminal ends of the peptides and the N-terminal end of the triple alanine until the corresponding ends were close enough to form a peptide bond. To conduct the bond, we deleted an oxygen atom from the C-terminal of the peptides and a hydrogen atom from the N-terminal of the linker. Subsequently, we were required to change the N-terminal of the linker to a sp2 hybridization and a neutral charge. Once the conditions of the corresponding terminal ends were adequate, we used the molecular editing tool of the software to create the peptide bond between the proteins and the linker. Then, we optimized the bond angles and distances of the binding region with a molecular minimization process.</p>
            <p>Finally, to complete the fusion protein, we repeated the methodology to merge the C-terminal of the linker with the N-terminal of the lectin (iGEM UAM, 2021)</p>
            <p>Throughout the procedure, we were aided by Dr. Jaqueline Padilla Zúñiga from the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana.</p>

            <p class="mt-2">Molecular dynamics simulations allow modeling the movement of atoms based on Newton's laws of motion, making it an essential tool for drug discovery. One of its many applications is to predict conformation and protein folding (De Vivo et al., 2016).</p>
            <p>Previously, we changed the third structure of the proteins when we fused each of them with the GNA carrier. Therefore, we were required to model their new tertiary structure. We used the computational software NAMD and the clusters from the institutional supercomputer YOLTLA to run a two hundred nanoseconds simulation of the solvated fusion proteins at twenty degrees Celcius and a neutral pH.</p>

            <p class="mt-3">As shown in the pictures above, we can observe that both fusion proteins tend to fold into a globular configuration. Said globularity is more prominent in the OAIP-1/GNA protein than the AcTx-Hv2a/GNA one. We can also notice that the configuration change comes from the folding of the alanine linker and the conjunct amino acid residues from the lectin and the corresponding insecticidal peptide</p>

            <h2 class="blog-title-line"></h2>
            <p class="mt-3">Once we had the model of each protein, we carried out molecular docking analysis between them and their respective targets, the sodium and calcium ion channels. The objective was to validate their action mechanism and hence corroborate their insecticidal effect on the targeted pests. Additionally, it permitted us to verify that the new configurations don't interfere with their insecticidal effect.</p>
            <p>We performed the molecular dockings via the server HDock and analyzed each fusion protein with its corresponding target. The protein carrying the AcTx-Hv2a peptide was studied with a voltage-gated calcium channel, and the one with the OAIP-1 peptide with a voltage-gated sodium channel.</p>
            <p>Due to the lack of properly characterized coleopteran ion channels, we used the sequence of the ones from the insect Drosophila melanogaster (fruit fly). Said channels have a homology of 89% (Smith et al., 2013) and 74% (King et al., 2008) with the sodium and calcium channels of the coleopteran insect Tribolium castaneum, respectively, providing suitable substitutes for the study.</p>
            <p>We evaluated the molecular docking results with the specialized software Discovery Studio. This program allowed us to visualize and analyze the interactions between the fusion proteins and the ion channels and, subsequently, to compare the results with the ones reported in the literature.</p>

            <p>As previously said, the ω-Hexatoxin-Hv2a is a potent pore blocker of the voltage-sensitive calcium channels. The action mechanism of this highly specific peptide is not yet fully comprehended. Nonetheless, there are putative mechanisms reported in the literature. The essence of the action mechanism is for the disulfide-bond-rich zone of the peptide to interact with the extracellular residues of the ion channel, interfering with the flow of ions (Wang et al., 2001)</p>

Distinct from the literature, the blocking of the pore is conducted by the insecticidal peptide and the carrier. Additionally, we can appreciate that the fusion protein does not entirely block the flow of calcium. However, it reduces enough the passage of ions to cause an inhibitory effect.</p>
