        Throughout the season we have carried out collaborations in most of the commissions with the Tec Chihuahua team in which we have beefed up our abilities to work as a team and delegate responsibilities appropriately. On the other hand, we have mutually influenced each other in our projects, providing a broad and multidisciplinary vision throughout our hard work.
      </p>
      <p>In addition to that, being teams from Latin America, we have linked a very significant collaboration. We know what our needs and strengths are in the scientific field in Mexico. One of the main weaknesses is the lack of scientific disclosure, the lack of scientific literature in our mother tongue.</p>
      <p>Due to the fact that our projects have multiple similarities in terms of the track (Food & Nutrition), this partnership arose spontaneously when we found various areas in which we could collaborate. On the human side, fraternizing with other iGEMers helped us to discuss the problems we encountered during the project and find solutions. We were able to vent our frustrations and were encouraged to continue, which was very valuable.</p>
      <p>The first work we did throughout the season was the collaboration in the mathematical model section with a manual for future teams that want to know how to start in this area. Then we participated in the comic collection called “The magic of synthetic biology” which included synthetic biology stories of different teams for children. After that, we saw that they were good partners and we decided to get involved in a more complex collaboration, which was a workshop named “Challenges in agriculture” that consisted of a set of talks, games, and a conservatory for having bilateral learning about agriculture topics. Finally, we also had a similar problem with the delivery method system of our products, which is why we decided to join forces and find a solution for a correct transport system for our peptides and in their case siRNAs and peptides. All of these collaborations were completed on time, and we are very happy to have collaborated with iGEM Chihuahua in this season.   <a href="{{url_for('pages', page="collaborations")}}" class="text-decoration-none text-dark btn btn-outline-success"> For more information about this collaborations go to [Collaborations]</a>

      <h2>Overview of the problem</h2>
      <p>Human population is increasing at a growth rate of 81 million people per year, causing an increase in the demand of food production. It is estimated that the population will reach 11 billion in this century with consequences such as: water crisis, economic issues,climate change, political confrontations and damage to the natural resources.  the tropical developing nations, by 70 % and 50 % worldwide will be necessary to produce enough food for everyone  (Pérez et al., 2018) . A study shows that taking into account climate change the total global food demand is expected to increase by 30% to 62% between 2010 and 2050</p>
      <p>To satisfy this food demand, in needed more farm land. In Mexico for example there is 27.5 million hectares of arable land but it is getting depletive. However the creation of more land for agriculture will affect natural areas and aquatic ecosystems. Consequently, it generates fewer tolls for absorbing the CO2, an increase in nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization. These changes will gradually affect the diversity and composition of the prevailing ecosystems all over the world. Therefore, we have to promote the increase of output in the agricultural fields already established instead of their expansion. (Laurance et al., 2014).
      </p>
      <p>One of the problems to increase the production in the agricultural fields are the losses caused by pests. Acording to the FAO the pests are the cause of the losses in the agricultural production up to a 40%. A strategy that Mexico has used to control the pests are the pesticides, from 2000-2014 the consumption of pesticides in Mexico rose by 59.2%. However the use of coventional pesticides has deleteriuos effects, their residues that can persist in the environment and agricultural crops and has been demonstrated that these produce long-term negative effects on the health of humans and animals and stability of ecosystems. In our country  this is a topic of concern because of the high levels of toxic contaminants (e.g. heavy metals, pesticides) that have been found in soil, water, and plants </p>
      <p>and animal species in some localities, and adverse effects on human health, especially in children, that have been identified. 
      </p>
      <p>In general we want to solve some problems derivated from pests:
