          Throughout the season we have carried out collaborations in most of the commissions with the Tec Chihuahua team in which we have beefed up our abilities to work as a team and delegate responsibilities appropriately. On the other hand, we have mutually influenced each other in our projects, providing a broad and multidisciplinary vision throughout our hard work.
        </p>
        <p>In addition to that, being teams from Latin America, we have linked a very significant collaboration. We know what our needs and strengths are in the scientific field in Mexico. One of the main weaknesses is the lack of scientific disclosure, the lack of scientific literature in our mother tongue.</p>
        <p>Due to the fact that our projects have multiple similarities in terms of the track (Food & Nutrition), this partnership arose spontaneously when we found various areas in which we could collaborate. On the human side, fraternizing with other iGEMers helped us to discuss the problems we encountered during the project and find solutions. We were able to vent our frustrations and were encouraged to continue, which was very valuable.</p>
        <p>The first work we did throughout the season was the collaboration in the mathematical model section with a manual for future teams that want to know how to start in this area. Then we participated in the comic collection called “The magic of synthetic biology” which included synthetic biology stories of different teams for children. After that, we saw that they were good partners and we decided to get involved in a more complex collaboration, which was a workshop named “Challenges in agriculture” that consisted of a set of talks, games, and a conservatory for having bilateral learning about agriculture topics. Finally, we also had a similar problem with the delivery method system of our products, which is why we decided to join forces and find a solution for a correct transport system for our peptides and in their case siRNAs and peptides. All of these collaborations were completed on time, and we are very happy to have collaborated with iGEM Chihuahua in this season.   <a href="{{url_for('pages', page="collaborations")}}" class="text-decoration-none text-dark btn btn-outline-success"> For more information about this collaborations go to [Collaborations]</a>
