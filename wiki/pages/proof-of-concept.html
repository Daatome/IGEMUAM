        <h2 class="blog-title">Peptides nature</h2>
        <h2 class="blog-title-line"></h2>
        <p>When we talk about biopesticides, it refers to substances that come from a living organism such as fungus, bacteria, plants, etc. Spidicide-CX is composed by two peptides (ω-HXTX-Hv2a and U1-theraphotoxin-Sp1a) from two venom spiders: <span class="fst-italic">Selenotypus plumipes</span> and <span class="fst-italic">Hadronyche versuta</span>.
        </p>
        <p>These peptides have been reported with toxic functions to neuronal receptors and voltage-gated sodium (NaV) and calcium (CaV) ions channels in insects (Shen et al., 2018). It is worth noting that their functions are highly specific for some insect orders, mainly the Coleoptera order, the order that belongs to the pests we intend to control.
        </p>
        <p>Also, these peptides are not toxic for human beign according to literature, and they have a high degradaation rate wich avoid the bioaccumulation. So, its use does not represent any risk to the environment either (Hardy et al., 2013).
        </p>
        <p>For more security, we search for related allergies to these peptides and similar peptides to be sure that its constant use does not affect the farmer's health. Fortunately, there are no allergies reported.</p>

        <h2>Proposed application of Spidicide-CX
        </h2>
        <h2 class="blog-title-line"></h2>
        <p>The growth of the world population causes a proportional increase in the demand for food, so the agricultural sector is one of the main sectors that are affected and under pressure. Due to this, the use of fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and other agrochemical compounds to maintain this demand has also increased, causing unwanted effects on crops and farmer’s health (Kah & Hofmann, 2013).
        </p>
        <p>Therefore, it is essential to search for new tools that, with the advancement of science, are potentially applicable to combat these problems and, at the same time, reduce costs, especially for stakeholders, increase productivity, improve efficiency and reduce environmental impact.
        </p>
        <p>The iGEM teams from Tec Chihuahua and UAM are solving similar local problems since both are developing biopesticides. Tec Chihuahua's active ingredients are two antimicrobial peptides and interfering RNA to counteract the losses in chili production caused by the oomycete<span class="fst-italic">  Phytophthora capsici</span>, which is one of the most destructive pathogens in chili crops. On the other hand, UAM is developing a biopesticide based on two spider venom peptides from Australian spiders to counteract the pests that cause the most damage to cactus, avocado, and agave crops. These pests are insects that belong to the Coleoptera order.</p>
        <p>Therefore, the two teams collaborated through in-depth research to determine a delivery method that could work for both biopesticides. Finally, we concluded that the nanotechnology field could be a great solution.</p>
        <p>The emerging application of nanotechnology-based pesticides is known as nanopesticides. These methods have made it possible to improve the efficacy of pesticides, reducing doses and improving the stability of the active ingredients, which reduces environmental impact. It is expected that these nanopesticides could contribute to traditional pest control strategies through the use of nanoparticles to more easily penetrate the target organism, be resistant to environmental conditions, and at the same time not affect the surrounding crops and wildlife (Smith et al., 2008).
